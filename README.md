Book Extractor automatically extracts text from books and organizes the text by chapter. It will generate statistics about the book used for analysis. 

I created this when exploring googles notebook LM. I wanted to create easy to digest chapter summaries, but in order to do that i needed the chapter text extracted from the PDFs. 

the program will try its best to extract the relavent text from books (removing the noise from graph anotations and things like that).
